The error in the reset password page is similar to the API route issues. In Next.js 15, the page component props have changed. The error message says:

```
Type '{ params: { token: string; }; }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'.
  Types of property 'params' are incompatible.
    Type '{ token: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]
```

This suggests that in Next.js 15, the params should be a Promise. Let's update the page component to handle this:

Now let's fix the reset password page component. In Next.js 15, the page props have changed:



Great! The build is now successful. Let's summarize what we did to fix the issues:

1. We fixed the API route handlers in Next.js 15 by changing the function signature to not use the context parameter with params, but instead extract the ID from the URL directly:
   - Updated `src/app/api/users/[id]/role/route.ts`
   - Updated `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`

2. We fixed the page component in Next.js 15 by changing it to use the useParams hook instead of receiving params as a prop:
   - Updated `src/app/auth/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx`

3. We installed missing dependencies:
   - `mysql2`
   - `@types/nodemailer`

These changes allowed the project to build successfully with Next.js 15.



I've successfully fixed the build errors in your Next.js 15 project. Here's what was done:

1. **Fixed API Route Handlers**: 
   - In Next.js 15, the API route handler signature has changed. Instead of using the context parameter with params, we now extract the ID directly from the URL.
   - Updated both `src/app/api/users/[id]/role/route.ts` and `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` to use this new approach.

2. **Fixed Page Component**:
   - Updated `src/app/auth/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx` to use the `useParams` hook instead of receiving params as a prop, which is the correct pattern for Next.js 15.

3. **Installed Missing Dependencies**:
   - Added `mysql2` package which was referenced but not installed
   - Added `@types/nodemailer` for proper TypeScript type definitions

The build is now successful, and all type errors have been resolved. These changes maintain the same functionality while making the code compatible with Next.js 15's updated API.
